function,"A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.",https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python
parameter,"A named entity in a function (or method) definition that specifies an argument (or in some cases, arguments) that the function can accept. ",https://docs.python.org/3.3/glossary.html
variable,"Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory. Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.",https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python
argument,"An argument is simply a value provided to a function when you call it. Arguments are usually contrasted with parameters, which are names used to specify what arguments a function will need when it is called. When a function is called, each parameter is assigned one of the argument values.",http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14924825/what-are-arguments-in-python
dictionary,"A Dictionary is a sequence of data. It is a way to store data just like a list, but instead of using only numbers to get the data, you can use almost anything. This lets you treat a dictionary like it's a database for storing and organizing data.",https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex39.html
tuple,"A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.",https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python
ASCII table,"Short for American Standard Code for Information Interexchange, ASCII is an standard that assigns letters, numbers, and other characters within the 256 slots available in the 8-bit code. The ASCII decimal (Dec) number is created from binary, which is the language of all computers. As shown in the table below, the lower case ""h"" character (Char) has a decimal value of 104, which is ""01101000"" in binary. The ASCII table is divided in 3 different sections: Non printable - system codes between 0 and 31, Lower ASCII -  between 32 and 127. This table originates from the older, American systems, which worked on 7-bit character tables, Higher ASCII - between 128 and 255. This portion is programmable; characters are based on the language of your operating system or program you are using. Foreign letters are also placed in this section.",http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/ascii.htm
module,"A module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code. A module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference.",https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python
list,The list is a sequence of data. It is a most versatile datatype available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Important thing about a list is that items in a list need not be of the same type.,https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python
loop,"A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. The following diagram illustrates a loop statement. Python programming language provides following types of loops to handle looping requirements: for loop, while loop and nested loops",https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_loops.htm
lambda,An anonymous inline function consisting of a single expression which is evaluated when the function is called. The syntax to create a lambda function is lambda [arguments]: expression,https://docs.python.org/3.3/glossary.html
array,An array is a group of related data values (called elements) that are grouped together. All of the array elements must be the same data type. ,http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/array.htm
class,"In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)
method,"A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object is mostly made up of data and behavior, which form the interface that an object presents to the outside world. Data is represented as properties of the object and behavior as methods. For example, a Window object would have methods such as open and close, while its state (whether it is opened or closed) would be a property.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)
object,"In computer science, an object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, is a location in memory having a value and possibly referenced by an identifier. In the class-based object-oriented programming paradigm, ""object"" refers to a particular instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures. In relational database management, an object can be a table or column, or an association between data and a database entity (such as relating a person's age to a specific person).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)
